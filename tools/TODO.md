Things to do
- Document all code and make the doxygen/readthedocs clean
- clean the Python bindings links and pathes, retest
- numerical unit test for FF in 2D : circles, area round, ellipses, mass conservation for heat fluxes
- numerical tests for fuel models in 2D.. slopes, wind. Best would be 1 model 10 slopes for same wind. Simple ones.
- include all Firecaster FF models into wildfire ROS library
- make a special CMAKE with/for MesoNH that will symlink the library so it will work directly if profile_mesonh is set
- use of ERA 40 to reanalyse any wildfire using FF/MNH
- A simple python case to put weather files into a FF simulation and same script by FF script
- a vector of fireDomains in session to perform ensembles.
- generate a fuel file with different water stress
- a list of examples and coupled test cases directly in ForeFire
- stuff to make ff from shapefiles
- stuff to make ATmap from fffiles
- stuf to get stats from ATmap
- compute FWI in C++ from mars/arome
- perform a reanalysis on several wildfires in europe, calibrate adjustment speeds with it
- MesoNH Sandbox
