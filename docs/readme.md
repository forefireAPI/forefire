# Documentation with Read the Docs

## Stack explanation

This project uses a combination of tools to generate comprehensive documentation:

*   **Doxygen:** Parses the C++ source code comments (`/** ... */`) to automatically generate a detailed API reference (classes, functions, variables, etc.). It outputs this information as XML files.
*   **Sphinx:** The main documentation generator. It takes narrative content written in reStructuredText (`.rst`) or Markdown (`.md`) files and builds the final documentation website (HTML), PDFs, or other formats.
*   **Breathe:** A Sphinx extension that acts as a bridge. It reads the XML files generated by Doxygen and allows embedding the C++ API documentation seamlessly within the Sphinx-generated pages, creating a single, unified documentation site.
*   **ReadTheDocs:** The platform used for automatically building, hosting, and versioning the official online documentation website from our GitHub repository.
*   **(Theme) sphinx-rtd-theme:** The visual theme used for the Sphinx documentation, providing the look and feel consistent with many other open-source projects.

## How to Build the Documentation Locally

This is useful for previewing changes before committing or pushing them.

**Prerequisites:**

-   **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher. `pip` and `venv` should be included.
-   **Doxygen:** The Doxygen executable must be installed and available in your system's PATH (`sudo apt install doxygen` or `brew install doxygen`)

**Steps:**

1.  **Set up Python Virtual Environment:**

    Navigate to the `docs` directory and create/activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd docs
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    You should see `(.venv)` prepended to your shell prompt.

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    Install Sphinx, Breathe, the theme, and other necessary Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r source/requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate Doxygen XML Output:**

    Run Doxygen to parse the C++ source code and generate the XML files that Breathe needs. **Run this from the repository root directory.**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the ROOT directory of the repository
    # If you are inside 'docs', cd ..
    doxygen docs/doxygen/Doxyfile
    ```

4.  **Build the Documentation with Sphinx:**

    Now, run the Sphinx build process using the Makefile provided by Sphinx. Make sure you are in the `docs` directory (where the Makefile resides).
    ```bash
    # cd docs

    # Optional: Clean previous builds
    make clean

    # Build the HTML documentation
    make html
    ```

**Optional**

- View the Documentation: (need to enable html output on Doxygen)

    Open the generated HTML documentation in your web browser.
    ```
    # Path is relative to the 'docs' directory
    open _build/html/index.html
    ```
    (Or use `start _build\html\index.html` on Windows, or navigate via your file explorer).

- **Graphviz (Optional but Recommended):** Doxygen uses Graphviz (specifically the `dot` tool) to generate diagrams (like call graphs, inheritance graphs). If you want these diagrams, install Graphviz (`sudo apt install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`).
- **(Optional) C++ Compiler & CMake:** Doxygen parses C++ code. While it might work without a full build environment, having the compiler and CMake setup (needed to build ForeFire itself) can sometimes help Doxygen find system headers if needed.

## Deployment
- Deployment needs to be configured via the GUI of readthedocs
- The file `.readthedocs.yaml` contains the necessary configuration
