Installation: Build from Source
================================

This guide explains how to install ForeFire by compiling it directly on your Linux/Unix-like system. This gives you a native build, but requires managing dependencies.
There are two main ways to build from source:

- Option 1: Using the provided install script (easiest for Debian/Ubuntu)
- Option 2: Following manual steps (for all systems or finer control).

Prerequisites
-------------

If you choose the **manual build steps** (Option 2), or if you simply want to understand what tools are needed, you must ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler:** A modern C++ compiler (like `g++`). Package typically called `build-essential` or similar.
- **CMake:** Build system generator (`cmake`).
- **Make:** Build tool (`make`).
- **NetCDF Libraries:** ForeFire requires NetCDF support. The specific package needed is the C++ interface.

  - On **Debian/Ubuntu**, the install script uses `libnetcdf-c++4-dev`.
  - On other systems, find the equivalent package (e.g., `netcdf-cxx-devel`, `netcdf-cxx4`).
  - *Note: Ensure this is the correct/intended library. Older docs might mention `libnetcdf-cxx-legacy-dev`. Verify which one is actually required by the current CMake setup.*

Build Options
-------------

**Option 1: Using the Install Script (Recommended for Debian/Ubuntu)**

The repository provides a convenience script (`install-forefire.sh`) that automates the process on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

  .. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/forefireAPI/forefire.git
    cd forefire

2.  **Run the install script:**

  .. warning::

    This script requires `sudo` privileges to install system packages using `apt`. Review the script if you have concerns.

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo bash install-forefire.sh

**What the Install Script Does:**

- **Updates Package Lists and Installs Dependencies:** Runs `apt-get update` and installs prerequisites listed above
- **Builds ForeFire:** using CMake and Make.
- **Reports Install Location:** Prints the location of the built binaries (usually `$PROJECT_ROOT/bin`).
- **(Optional) Updates PATH:**

  - Prompts the user if they want to add the ForeFire `bin` directory to their PATH permanently.
  - If 'yes', it appends `export PATH=` and `export FOREFIREHOME=` lines to the user's `~/.bashrc` file.
  - It tries to detect the correct user's home directory even when run with `sudo` (using `$SUDO_USER`).
  - **Note:** This only modifies `.bashrc`. If you use a different shell (like `zsh` or `fish`), you will need to configure the PATH manually (see below).

**Option 2: Manual Build Steps (All Linux/Unix-like Systems)**

Use this method if you are not on Debian/Ubuntu, prefer manual control, or don't want to use the install script.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

  .. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/forefireAPI/forefire.git
    cd forefire

2.  **Install Prerequisites Manually:**

  Use your system's package manager to install `cmake`, `make`, a C++ compiler (`build-essential` or equivalent), and the required NetCDF C++ development library (e.g., `libnetcdf-c++4-dev`, `netcdf-cxx-devel`, etc.).
  Example for Debian/Ubuntu (if not using the script):
  
  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential cmake libnetcdf-c++4-dev # Verify package name!

3.  **Create a build directory and run CMake & Make:**

  .. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

The main executable `forefire` will be located at `../bin/forefire` (relative to the `build` directory). Check installation with
  
  .. code-block:: bash

    cd .. # Go back to the root of the repository
    ./bin/forefire -v

4. **Making ForeFire Executable System-Wide (Manual PATH setup)**

  If you built from source (manually or via the script but declined the automatic PATH update, or use a shell other than bash), the `forefire` executable is in the `bin` directory within the repository. To run it easily from any location, add this directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

  **For the current terminal session:**

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Execute this from the root of the forefire repository
    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin

  **Permanently:**

  Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`). Replace `/path/to/forefire` with the actual absolute path to the cloned repository.

  .. code-block:: bash

    export PATH="/path/to/forefire/bin:$PATH"

  *Optional:* The install script also sets `export FOREFIREHOME="/path/to/forefire"`. You may want to add this line as well, as some scripts or components might potentially use it.

  .. code-block:: bash

    export FOREFIREHOME="/path/to/forefire"

  After editing your configuration file, either restart your terminal or reload the configuration (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`).
