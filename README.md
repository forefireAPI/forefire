**ForeFire** is an open-source wildfire spread simulator written in C++. Developed by CNRS at the [Université de Corse Pascal Paoli](https://www.univ-corse.fr/), it's designed for research and operational forecasting. ForeFire implements various fire behavior models (e.g., based on Rothermel equations), handles complex geospatial data, and enables high-fidelity coupled fire-atmosphere simulations via integration with atmospheric models like [MesoNH](https://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/mesonh/) (developed by CNRS & Météo-France).

*   🚀 **Live Demo:** [forefire.univ-corse.fr/sim](http://forefire.univ-corse.fr/sim)
<!-- *   📚 **Full Documentation:** [your-rtd-project-name.readthedocs.io](https://your-rtd-project-name.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  -->

## Features

*   **Advanced Simulation:** Core C++ engine for fire propagation using geospatial data (terrain, fuel, weather).
*   **Fire-Atmosphere Coupling:** Integrates with MesoNH for realistic wind-fire interaction modeling.
*   **High Performance:** Optimized for speed, capable of faster-than-real-time simulations on laptops, with MPI support for parallel computing.
*   **Multiple Interfaces:** Usable via C++ library, Python bindings, interactive console (IPython-like), web interface (notebook mode), and shell scripts.
*   **Extensible:** Add custom Rate of Spread (ROS) models in C++; customize web interfaces using HTML/JS.
*   **Applications:** Suitable for research, detailed case reanalysis, and ensemble forecasting.


## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is often using Docker and the interactive console. Alternatively, build from source using the provided script.

``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/forefireAPI/firefront.git
cd firefront
```

### 1. Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build . -t forefire:latest

# Run the container interactively
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 --name ff_interactive forefire bash

# Inside the container navigate to test directory:
cd tests/runff

# start forefire console 
forefire

#inside the console launch an http server with listenHttp[] command
forefire> listenHTTP[]

# the output should be
>> HTTP command server listening on port 8000
```

Now that the server is running, acces the console on your browser at http://localhost:8000/

- Run the command `include[real_case.ff]`
- Then press Refresh Map

You can interact and simulate events in the region of Corse, south of France

### 2. From Source (using install script)

```bash
# Prerequisites:
# You need a C++ compiler, CMake, Make, and libraries like NetCDF.
# See the Documentation or inspect install-forefire.sh for details.

sudo bash install-forefire.sh

# The executable will be built in: `./bin/forefire`

# Examples are provided on the `tests` folder. You can inspect `tests/runff/run.bash` to check usage
# example
cd tests/runff
bash run.bash

```
(For manual CMake build instructions, see the Full Documentation).

## Python Bindings
ForeFire provides Python bindings for easier scripting and integration. See the Python Bindings [./bindings/python/README.md](./bindings/python/README.md) for details.
