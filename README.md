**ForeFire** is an open-source **wildfire simulation engine** written in C++. Developed by CNRS at the [Universit√© de Corse Pascal Paoli](https://www.univ-corse.fr/), it is used for research and operational forecasting. The engine implements various fire behavior models and enables high-fidelity coupled fire-atmosphere simulations, aiming to improve wildfire prediction and understanding for complex environments.

## Features

*   **Advanced Simulation Engine:** Core C++ logic for fire propagation using various Rate of Spread (ROS) models and handling complex geospatial data (NetCDF).
*   **Fire-Atmosphere Coupling:** Designed for two-way coupling by linking the core library with atmospheric models like [MesoNH](https://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/mesonh/) (developed by CNRS & M√©t√©o-France).
*   **High Performance:** Optimized C++ core with MPI support for parallel computing.
*   **Flexible Interfaces:** Built upon a core **C++ Simulation Engine (Library)**:
    *   **`forefire` Interpreter:** The primary way to run simulations using script files (`.ff`), interactive console commands, or the web interface (via `listenHTTP[]`).
    *   **C++ Library (`libforefireL`):** Allows direct integration into other software.
    *   **Python Bindings:** Enable scripting and control from Python (see [./bindings/python/README.md](./bindings/python/README.md)).
*   **Flexible Output:** Can generate outputs in various formats, including KML for visualization in Google Earth, Geojson, NetCDF, and custom binary/text formats.
*   **Extensible:** Add custom ROS models in C++; customize web interfaces.
*   **Applications:** Research, case reanalysis, ensemble forecasting.


## Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to get started is often using Docker and the interactive console, via the **`forefire` command-line interpreter** 

![ForeFire Web UI showing a simulation example](docs/source/_static/images/gui_real_case_ff.jpg)

1. Clone the repository
    
    ``` bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/forefireAPI/forefire.git
    cd forefire
    ```

2. Build the Docker image 

    ```bash
    docker build . -t forefire:latest
    ```

3. Run the container interactively

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 --name ff_interactive forefire bash
    ```
4. Inside the container navigate to test directory and lauch the forefire console:
    ```bash
    cd tests/runff

    # start the forefire console with the command
    forefire
    ```

5. Inside the console launch an http server with listenHttp[] command

    ```bash
    forefire> listenHTTP[]

    # the output should be
    >> ForeFire HTTP command server listening at http://localhost:8000
    ```

    This server provides a grafical user interface that you can access on your browser at http://localhost:8000/

6. Run your first simulation
    - Run the command `include[real_case.ff]`
    - Then press Refresh Map

    You should see a simulation running in the Aull√®ne region of Corsica. **This confirms your Docker setup is working!** Check the full documentation for more details on this example

## Build from source

See the Full Documentation for more details on building from source with the `install-forefire.sh` file

## Python Bindings
ForeFire provides Python bindings for easier scripting and integration. See the Python Bindings [./bindings/python/README.md](./bindings/python/README.md) for details.
